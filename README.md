## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  Interact with the 'Start Game' button to begin playing the game
-  Enter their letter of choice & recieve correct validation if invalid
-  Submit their letter of choice and receive confirmation of whether they guessed correctly
-  The timer should terminate after 30 seconds and prompt the user to re-start the game
-  For each incorrect guess, an additional version of the hangman image should be displayed, as well decreasing the number of guesses remaining
-  Each correctly guessed letter should be displayed to the user at its corresponding position in the word

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Flexbox
-  Vanilla JS
-  ES6 Modules

### What I learned

```html
<p id="word-to-guess">
   <span id="letter0">_</span>
   <span id="letter1">_</span>
   <span id="letter2">_</span>
   <span id="letter3">_</span>
</p>
```

I first attempted to reveal the correctly guessed letter within one single `<p>`, before then realising I needed to individually match each letter position with that corresponding letter's index value in the 'selected word' array. I was proud of my ability to semantically produce this solution inside a `<p>` wrapper, using `<span>` tags which wouldn't add any more unnecessary semantic meaning to the words' markup.

```html
<pre id="hangman-img" class="hangman">
      +â€”+
      | |
   
         |
   
         |
   
         |
   
         |
   
   =========
</pre>
```

This project was my first time using the `<pre>` tag in action which, although is clearly powerful in displaying whatever string data you pass to it, also presents a major issue in controlling the alignment of the data because it's all controlled via manually created spaces. In the future it would be better to use images of each hangman position, which could then be controlled much nicer within the CSS as a background image with the same position and size to achieve uniformity.

```css
.error-icon {
   background: url('/images/exclamation-solid.svg') no-repeat 90% center / 4%;
}
```

To add to the visual representation of invalidly inputted data, I decided to practice dynamically toggling different background icons from an error class which was applied to the input. For future project I feel using a fixed px value for the positioning could help with controlling the icon's position if other content around it were to responsively adjust.

```js
   timerBegin: () => setInterval(timerCount, 1000),
   timerEnd: () => clearInterval(finish),
```

In order to build the restricted timer logic, I had to first setup the timer using the built in asynchronous function `setInterval()`, and further learn how to cancel it appropiately based on specific events occuring. This callback function will probably end up being more useful than setTimeout() in future projects, but I will need to research how to account for 'browser teething' issues, which causes the function to run at a increasingly delayed time compared to the amount you manually set.

```js
const random = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1
const word = words[random()]
functions.element(guess, 'value', '')
return word.split('')
```

This small block of code performed an important amount of logic in a relatively refactored manner considering my current development stage in learning JavaScript. I was proud of my ability to run the `random()` function inside the array selection syntax, as well as making use of the `split()` method to return that word in the desired format. I do believe next time I could practice chaining methods directly onto the word selection, and implicitly returning that value all within one line of code.

```js
if (isPlaying) {
   const regex = /[a-z]/g
   if (
      regex.test(val) &&
      val.length === 1 &&
      !correctGuesses.includes(val)
         ) {...}
}
```

Once again, I was really proud of the above code because it utilises a lot of efficient logic and techniques which I had only recently learnt in my JavaScript journey. The `isPlaying` variable uses the traditional 'is' naming convention when some form of funcion or logic is returning a value or producing an outcome based on some form of boolean logic.

Although I had already used regular expressions before this project, I was still proud of my ability to create one on the fly for this purpose without needing to research how. They can certainly be a very powerful feature of the language to reach for when validating user's input.

### Continued development

In regards to storing the words which were used in the game, I chose to hardcode them into an array manually to test if my random number selection logic worked. However, in the future I realise you would pull this kind of data from an external API, which could therefore be much more dynamic in creating different topics and word lengths.

I kept track of the game's 'state' through multiple number variables in the global scope, which in the future I will try to refactor by potentially using an object to contain all of them, or reverse their individual logic for multiple purposes (if one increaes then the other should decrease).

I also used ES6 modules to import the string based hangman images into my primary app, yet not for the rest of the project. For future projects I would like to explore refactoring my code further by modelling the whole app with modules, even though at the current time I find it easier to organise myself within one file.

### Useful resources

-  [Pig Game Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - Completing this game in advance really helped me with a lot of the base logic for games in general, such as only executing the game via boolean logic which determines if it is currently being played (the user has pressed the 'start' button).

-  [JavaScript - ES6 Modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRHQNNcYf6s&t=283s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - Kyle's quick crash course like tutorial helped me quickly get up to speed with Modules in JavaScript, focusing on the theory behind how they work and the difference between default and named imports.
